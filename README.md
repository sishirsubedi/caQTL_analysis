Multimodal analysis for discovery of complex trait genetics
</span>

In this project, I am interested in exploring multimodal (scATAC + scRNA + SNPs) data integration problems to reveal interesting disease mechanisms. [Zhang et al 2023](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(22)00190-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666979X22001902%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) paper analyzes data from COVID-19 patients and connects genetic variations, epigenetic factors, and immune responses at the cellular level.
